Something from nothing.
Irreducible complexity.
Conservation of energy.
Is it a wave or particle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are etched into time by an instrument given to us
by no choice of our own. We are empowered through
the
melting of order. We discover that the universe is
in our own hand. Our hand is in our own mind. Our
mind in our own awareness. Our awareness in our
purpose. Our purpose in our own control. Our control
in our own existence and our existence in nothing.
What began in order, will end in uniformity. To
get there, we must pass through a system of
disorder. Yet,
uniformity is our beginning.
Who are we?
When will our time lose its meaning?&lt;/p&gt;

The whole world is knowable only through observation. The only way to observe is in person. In person is being there, and being is the only thing that makes a person experience something. Being there to see it, kinda like life - just here to see it, to see where it leads. Who knows, maybe we are living on a big turtle about to shit a new universe. That the whole universe exists on the inner surface of a bubble from a turtle fart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the world add up to? What are these rocks, this dirt, trees, concrete, lakes, clouds, birds. Down to the inner core of liquefied iron up to the communication satellites beaming HBO to somebody's 45th floor apartment. Everything in between, every bit of every hundred page email thread and every pixel in every 4KHD bigscreen. From the coffee bean that made it to your palate only after it grew, was picked, shipped, washed, dried, shipped, warehoused, shipped, roasted, bagged, shipped again, measured, brewed, and then thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That coffee bean had a way more interesting life after picking. Or did it? It could have been picked, digested, transported, discarded, buried, moistened, cracked, emerged, grown and revealed again. Can you imagine how few beans enjoy the second route? Very few. Most get consumed by the higher order. All for a short buzz of vibrancy that we could have found by nurturing the bean in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurture nature to get a buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>existential absurdity</category><category>nature</category><category>process</category><category>purpose</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/turtle_turds/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 06:13:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Creature Comforts</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/creature-comforts/</link><dc:creator>revo</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excerpt from The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred and forty fourth printing, Sept 2007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt from on houses: p32-33&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.
It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh.
It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in the thistledown like frail vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>comfort</category><category>desire</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/creature-comforts/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 17:49:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Animals and Stars</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/animals-and-stars/</link><dc:creator>revo</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look up at night! If you live in the city you probably don't see much. We have polluted the night sky with our desire to be constantly in motion, to be constantly entertained and be constantly surrounded by light. I like the dark. I like it really dark and I like to be outside when it's really dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can't tell if other animals see the milky way and wonder. Isn't that what makes us human in a way? To look up and feel small and yet be so full of wonder and amazement. I say that the Milky Way is in some ways responsible for human progress. At some point our brains were able to appreciate the heavens. Today, we overlook it and many haven't even seen it. Isn't it silly that this opportunity is not valued? To see the stars - I propose that it is one of the important factors that set us apart from other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cosmos</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/animals-and-stars/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 01:35:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>vagrant</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/vagrant/</link><dc:creator>revo</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Need vagrant and virtualbox-qt.

They really are more aligned than one would think. Without money, how would one go about getting all of the things that the human soul has deep in the echo filled well of desire? How would there be diversification of labor? Specialization, and to a large degree progress requires the collective interests that money promotes. Money is second only to language in giving humanity the social tools necessary for cooperation. However, just like too many words doesn't get you much peace so too much money doesn't get you many friends. Now a moment of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when money causes war? Money doesn't cause war. Suffering causes war. Money doesn't alleviate suffering, but giving it does. Words cannot be bought and money cannot buy dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>work</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/something-gives/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2017 02:30:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Emacs trial</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/emacs-trial/</link><dc:creator>revo</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a trial for an emacs feature for posting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>emacs</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/emacs-trial/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2017 08:47:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Camel Fodder</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/camel-fodder/</link><dc:creator>revo</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camels are able to eat just about anything.

I think I've fallen down the rabbit hole. I know what I hope to find, but I don't think I'm in Kansas anymore. All of this bourne again talk, a python infested environment and a little octocat to keep me connected to the giant web. The world of coders is highly complex and creatively magical. I wonder what the universe is creating with computers. I wonder if the universe listens to the signal of every keystroke on my wireless keyboard. One can only hope it preparing a good and long future. But my more spiritual inclinations are that it may only be good for some and then I realize that good and bad are all just labels for universal matters. A long time is all relative to a light show that emerged from darkness and nothingness. Ugh, now I should see if this works because my brain is sparking.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>thoughts</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/slan-go-foill/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 05:49:08 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
