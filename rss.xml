&lt;p&gt;As it torches the matter of yesterday,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It contemplates the mystery of growth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A purpose to become one with the flame,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recover the pure things where nothing else is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flame sings a song that is heard only once,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dances to its own ashen song,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every place in every time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light from a fire passes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only fire that consumes as it produces,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching lower for a more stable state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me some of that energy that you release!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please give me some of the heat that my body needs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need a flame to prepare my meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burning embers sooth my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind is calmed by the crackling of the flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no longer afraid of the fire,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having acquired a burning pain,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No longer can I be concerned with consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are these people that I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they aware of the fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do they have a fear of the consuming power of flame?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can they grasp that existance is from fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of fire,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the ashen remains of something been made pure,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some material that was created in the inferno,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole environment will rise from these ashes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world itself was given life in a flame,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will there be any witness as this flame consumes it again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a sight it will be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story that can never be told,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With words that can be uttered no more,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the heat from the fire rises to escape,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So will today;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising up;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burn-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>poem</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/embers-of-time/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 04:27:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Animals and Stars</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/animals-and-stars/</link><dc:creator>bimi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look up at night! If you live in the city you probably don't see much. We have polluted the night sky with our desire to be constantly in motion, to be constantly entertained and be constantly surrounded by light. I like the dark. I like it really dark and I like to be outside when it's really dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can't tell if other animals see the milky way and wonder. Isn't that what makes us human in a way? To look up and feel small and yet be so full of wonder and amazement. I say that the Milky Way is in some ways responsible for human progress. At some point our brains were able to appreciate the heavens. Today, we overlook it and many haven't even seen it. Isn't it silly that this opportunity is not valued? To see the stars - I propose that it is one of the important factors that set us apart from other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cosmos</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/animals-and-stars/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 01:35:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>vagrant</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/vagrant/</link><dc:creator>revo</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Need vagrant and virtualbox-qt.

They really are more aligned than one would think. Without money, how would one go about getting all of the things that the human soul has deep in the echo filled well of desire? How would there be diversification of labor? Specialization, and to a large degree progress requires the collective interests that money promotes. Money is second only to language in giving humanity the social tools necessary for cooperation. However, just like too many words doesn't get you much peace so too much money doesn't get you many friends. Now a moment of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when money causes war? Money doesn't cause war. Suffering causes war. Money doesn't alleviate suffering, but giving it does. Words cannot be bought and money cannot buy dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>work</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/something-gives/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2017 02:30:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Emacs trial</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/emacs-trial/</link><dc:creator>revorefurb</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a trial for an emacs feature for posting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>emacs</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/emacs-trial/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2017 08:47:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Camel Fodder</title><link>http://twohourslate.com/posts/camel-fodder/</link><dc:creator>revorefurb</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Camels are able to eat just about anything.

I think I've fallen down the rabbit hole. I know what I hope to find, but I don't think I'm in Kansas anymore. All of this bourne again talk, a python infested environment and a little octocat to keep me connected to the giant web. The world of coders is highly complex and creatively magical. I wonder what the universe is creating with computers. I wonder if the universe listens to the signal of every keystroke on my wireless keyboard. One can only hope it preparing a good and long future. But my more spiritual inclinations are that it may only be good for some and then I realize that good and bad are all just labels for universal matters. A long time is all relative to a light show that emerged from darkness and nothingness. Ugh, now I should see if this works because my brain is sparking.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>thoughts</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/slan-go-foill/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 05:49:08 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
