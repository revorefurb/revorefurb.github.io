As it torches the matter of yesterday,
It contemplates the mystery of growth,
A purpose to be burned in the fire,
To recover the pure things where nothing else is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flame sings a song that is heard only once,
It dances to its own ashen song,
In every place in every time,
Light from a fire passes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only fire that consumes as it produces,
Reaching lower for a more stable state.
Give me some of that energy that you release!
Please give me some of the heat that my body needs!
I need a flame to prepare my meal.
The burning embers sooth my eyes.
My mind is calmed by the crackling of the flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no longer afraid of the fire,
Having acquired a burning pain,
No longer can I be concerned with consumption.
Who are these people that I know.
Are they aware of the fire?
Do they have a fear of the consuming power of flame?
Can they grasp that existance is from fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of fire,
From the ashen remains of something been made pure,
Some material that was created in the inferno,
A whole environment will rise from these ashes!
The world itself was given life in a flame,
Will there be any witness as this flame consumes it again?
What a sight it will be!
A story that can never be told,
With words that can be uttered no more,
Like the heat from the fire rises to escape,
So will today;
Rising up;
Leaving;
Burn-
As I burn.
There is no return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>poem</category><guid>http://twohourslate.com/posts/embers-of-time/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 04:27:24 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
